Collection data types
---*---*---
DEFINITION
___
A collection data type is a complex data type that is composed of one or more elements of other data types. A collection data type should be divisible into smaller data components, without changing any individual element.
___
An integer object is composed of a single element of integer data type, hence is not a collection data type.
___
A collection data type may be ordered (i.e. elements are present in a defined and constant order) or unordered.

IDENTIFIER OF A COLLECTION DATA TYPE
___
The identifier of a collection data type is in fact a pointer to the location of the first element in the collection.
___
Hence, even if do any of the following
- you pass a collection's name as an argument to a function
- assign the collection's name's value to another identifier
... in both cases, any changes you make in the other identifier (function argument or duplicate) will reflect in the original collection itself, since each identifier points to the same memory address.
