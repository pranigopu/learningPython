Figure object in Plotly
---*---*---
The plotly Python package exists to create, manipulate and render graphical figures (i.e. charts, plots, maps and diagrams) represented by data structures also referred to as figures.

Figures can be represented in Python either as dictionaries or as instances of the plotly.graph_objects.Figure class. If represented as dictionaries, they must either be processed by the show function in the module plotly.io to be rendered as a Figure object, or be passed to the Figure class constructor.
