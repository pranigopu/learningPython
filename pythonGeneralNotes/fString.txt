f string in Python
---*---*---
This is essentially a string with variable parts i.e. containing values from variables. For example, suppose in the following string:
myString = "Hello, my name is XYZ"
you want to be able to replace XYZ with any name assigned beforehand to a variable 'myName':
myName = "Gopinath"
___
Then, you can create an f string with the required section being the variable part, as follows:
myString = f"Hello, my name is {myName}"
___
Now, whatever value you give to 'myName" will be reflected in myString.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The value of 'myName' or any placeholder variable you used must be given before you make the f string. Changing the variable after the f string has been assigned has no effect on the f string's value.
