Module
---*---*---
In general, a module is a set of standardized parts or independent units that can be used to construct a more complex structure, such as an item of furniture or a building.
___
In programming, a module is a separate set of independent or interdependent objects, defintions and routines (i.e. sets of procedures grouped under a single callable name). One or more parts of a module can be included in a program.

Modules enable us to
- reuse code
- classify code based on functionality
========================
SOME NOTABLE MODULES
1. plotly
2. numpy
3. pandas
------------------------
1. plotly
___
The plotly Python package exists to create, manipulate and render graphical figures (i.e. charts, plots, maps and diagrams) represented by data structures also referred to as figures.

Figures can be represented in Python either as dicts or as instances of the plotly.graph_objects.Figure class.
------------------------
2. numpy
___
NumPy is an open source Python package used for scientific computing, started by Travis Oliphant in 2005.

It provides fast and efficient array computing, since although it is a Python library, its underlying functionality is written in C, which is a much faster language than Python.

It offers various mathematical functions, including random number generators, linear algebra routines and Fourier transforms.

It is based on optimised code written in C.

It provides Python's flexibility as well as the speed of compiled code. Its instructions follow a high level syntax, making it easy to grasp and use.
-----------------------
3. pandas
___
pandas is a fast, versatile, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built using Python, started by Wes McKinney in 2008.
___
It includes features such as
- A fast and efficient DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing.
- Tools for reading and writing data between different formats
  (such as CSV, text files, Microsoft Excel and SQL databases)
- Intelligent data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.
- Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets.
- Intelligent label based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets.
- Columns can be inserted and deleted from data structures for size mutability.
- High performance merging and joining of data sets.
- Time series functionality.
- Highly optimized for performance.
