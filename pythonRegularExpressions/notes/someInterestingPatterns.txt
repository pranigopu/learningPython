SOME INTERESTING PATTERNS
---*---*---
wordSplitPattern = r"[\.\,\"]*\s+[\.\,\"]*"
___
The word split pattern allows for any combination of period, comma and double quote before or after the whitespace.
This ensures that these special symbols are removed from the word to which they are attached.
This is not the same as r"\.+|\,+|\"+|\s+", as this one checks for a sequence of consecutive characters of the same type.
---*---*---
lineSplitPattern = r"\.\s+"
___
The line split pattern presupposes an identification of sentences wherein
1. It has at least one period.
2. It has at least one whitespace after the period.
(Whitespace includes newline and end of file)
