Exceptions
---*---*---
An exception is an error or another extraordinary case that happens during a program's execution, and must be handled differently if at all.

If an exception is not caught, the program is terminated. In Python, exceptions are triggered automatically on errors, and they can be triggered and intercepted by your code.
