LAYOUT MANAGEMENT
---*---*---
The widgets are only placed on screen when their location within a given layout is specified.
___
There are three primary layout managers in tkinter, namely Grid, Pack and Place.
========================
NATURE OF WIDGET OBJECTS
---*---*---
Apparently, every widget object is a dictionary-like structure. The keys are the attribute names, and each key i.e. attribute name is attached to a value.
___
This is why we cannot access the attributes of a widget object using __getAttribute__, since its attributes are bundled in a dictionary-like structure.
========================
ACCESSING AND CHANGING ATTRIBUTES...
---*---*---
To access the attribute values of a widget, we can either do...
widgetObject["attributeName"]
or
widgetObject.cget("attributeName")
___
You can change these accessed attributes for the object as...
widgetObject["attributeName"] = newValues (just as you would in a dictionary)
or
widgetObject.configure(attributeName = newValues)
___
NOTE:
config and configure have the same functionality.
