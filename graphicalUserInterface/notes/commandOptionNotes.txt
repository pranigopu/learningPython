COMMAND OPTION NOTES
---*---*---
Many widgets offer a command option, where you can give a function name to be run whenever some trigger event happens (such as mouse-click, for buttons).
___
However, for a proper trigger functionality, remember to only give the function name. This is because while no error will be thrown if you include brackets (as in a function call) and maybe add arguments (if the function so demands), the function will be run without any trigger event when the program's execution reaches that line.
