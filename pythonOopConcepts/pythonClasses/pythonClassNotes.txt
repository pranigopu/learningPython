self
___
Within the class definition, self refers to an object of that class. It is the first argument in any nethod defined for the class, due to the follwing reasons...
- The methods in the class cannot refer to each other unattached to the class' object.
- The methods in the class cannot be called unattached the class' object.
- When you call a method as an object's attribute, you implicitly pass the object as well.
