IEX Cloud API batch calls (batch HTTP requests)
---*---*---
For official IEX Cloud information: https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/#batch-requests
---*---*---
The endpoint URL (see note on IEX Cloud API calls) remains unchanged until the name of the database, in our case 'stock'. To query multiple symbols from this database, add "/market/batch?" After the question mark, you must add the query string.

Creating the query string
___
The query string has 3 possible parameters:
1.
types (comma delimited list of endpoints to call from)
2.
symbols (comma delimited list of symbols on which to get response data)
3.
range (check the official documentation, we will not discuss or use it here)
___
Out of these, only 'types' required, and the rest are optional (since an API call is incomplete without defined endpoints). To add another parameter when one is already given, use '&'. You must also add '&' before giving the token (instead of the usual '?'). Also, note that the comma delimited list is given in a format such as the following...

parameter=element1,element2,element3

Don't give spaces, and note that 'parameter' and 'element1', 'element2' etc. are placeholders and must be replaced with valid values.
