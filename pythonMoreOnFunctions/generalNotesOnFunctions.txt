1.
Assigning identifiers to function names
___
Let's say there is a function defined under the name "fun"...
def fun(a, b):
	return a + b
(It may be any kind of function, this is just an example.
___
We may assign the function name to another identifier...
bore = fun
___
Now, bore identifies a function with the same definition as fun. Hence, we can call
bore(1, 2)
which will now give the same result as
fun(1, 2)
