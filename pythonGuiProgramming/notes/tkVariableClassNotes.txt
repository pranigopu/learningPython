APPLICATION / CONTROL VARIABLE CLASSES IN TKINTER
---*---*---
Some widgets, such as text entry widgets and radio buttons, can be connected directly to application variables by using special options:
- variable
- textvariable
- onvalue
- offvalue
- value
___
This connection works both ways. If the variable changes for any reason, the widget it's connected to will be updated to reflect the new value.
___
These Tkinter control variables are used like regular Python variables to keep certain values. It's not possible to hand over a regular Python variable to a widget through a variable or textvariable option. The only kinds of variables for which this works are variables that are subclassed from a class called Variable, defined in the Tkinter module. They are declared like this:
x = StringVar() # Holds a string; default value ""
x = IntVar() # Holds an integer; default value 0
x = DoubleVar() # Holds a float; default value 0.0
x = BooleanVar() # Holds a boolean, returns 0 for False and 1 for True
___
To read the current value of such a variable, call the method get(). The value of such a variable can be changed with the set() method.
